# Game Show Buzzer Race

Simple, single page html app orignally developed for a "Family Feud" game my family likes
to play each year at get-togethers.

## How to Play

Team A versus Team B buzzer beater game. Typically a question is asked, and the first team to press the button associated with their team gets the chance to answer it.

Specific game rules are up to you.

There are special-function keys:
* Press "Y" after a successful answer to hear a "ding ding" sound.
* Press "N" after a failed answer to hear a "dud dud" sound.

## Suggested setup (optional)

I purchased two foot pedals from Amazon (Hint: Look for "USB Foot Pedal"). Each one will emit a single key press when pressed. Attach them to the computer and use the pedals as buzzer buttons.
